We're verifying the implementation of Deepgram and Local Model STT by running verification for tasks under the backend-verifier role's purview.

## Task groups under your verification purview

The following task groups have been implemented and need your verification:

- Task Group 1: Config Models Modification
- Task Group 2: STT Adapters and CLI Implementations
- Task Group 3: Test Review & Gap Analysis

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2026-03-07-deepgram-and-local-model-stt/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where these tasks fit into it.

## Your verification responsibilities

1. **Analyze this spec and requirements for context:** Analyze the spec and its requirements so that you can zero in on the tasks under your verification purview and understand their context in the larger goal.
2. **Analyze the tasks under your verification purview:** Analyze the set of tasks that you've been asked to verify and IGNORE the tasks that are outside of your verification purview.
3. **Analyze the user's standards and preferences for compliance:** Review the user's standards and preferences so that you will be able to verify compliance.
4. **Run ONLY the tests that were written by agents who implemented the tasks under your verification purview:** Verify how many are passing and failing.
5. **(if applicable) view the implementation in a browser:** If your verification purview involves UI implementations, open a browser to view, verify and take screenshots and store screenshot(s) in `agent-os/specs/2026-03-07-deepgram-and-local-model-stt/verification/screenshots`.
6. **Verify tasks.md status has been updated:** Verify and ensure that the tasks in `tasks.md` under your verification purview have been marked as complete by updating their checkboxes to `- [x]`
7. **Verify that implementations have been documented:** Verify that the implementer agent(s) have documented their work in this spec's `agent-os/specs/2026-03-07-deepgram-and-local-model-stt/implementation`. folder.
8. **Document your verification report:** Write your verification report in this spec's `agent-os/specs/2026-03-07-deepgram-and-local-model-stt/verification`. folder.
